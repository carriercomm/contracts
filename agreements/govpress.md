        written. By accepting our proposal, you indicate that you:

        1.  Agree that our recommendations are appropriate based on the
            information available;

            based on the assumptions made in the proposal;
        3.  Understand that the total fees over the life of the contract
            may vary according to your Service Usage and your

        your website is accessible over the internet 100% of the time.

    4.  If despite OKF's reasonable efforts your website becomes unavailable,
        OKF will refund or waive the infrastructure fees for any period of
        unavailability longer than one hour.

5. ### Enhancement of the service

    1.  OKF may at any time make changes to GovPress without giving
        notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
        which may have an impact upon your use of GovPress.

    2.  OKF will not make any changes that remove or materially impair the
        supply of the services described in clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of this contract.

    3.  Changes made by OKF under this clause 5 will normally have no detectable
        effect on the operation of your website. If you make a reasonable request
        to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
        out of any change we have made to GovPress, we will make reasonable efforts
        to fix the reported problem.

6. ### Support

    1.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket.

    2.  OKF will make reasonable efforts to respond to Support Tickets
        within the period of time specified in our Service Level Agreement,
        which forms part of this contract.

    3.  All contact regarding the services OKF provides as part of this
        contract must be made via Support Tickets.

    4.  You understand that any contact you make with us that is not via a
        Support Ticket may be overlooked or disregarded and that any
        consequent failure on our part to respond to you or take or not take
        some action will not be a breach of this contract.

    5.  At any time, you may create an Emergency Support Ticket if you
        are experiencing a problem that meets the criteria for an
        emergency as described in the Service Level Agreement.

    6.  If you create Emergency Support Tickets in situations which do
        not meet the criteria for an emergency, OKF may withdraw your
        ability to submit Emergency Support Tickets.

    7.  You understand that if you are experiencing an emergency but
        do not create an Emergency Support Ticket, our response time
        may be considerably increased and your service may be disrupted
        for a prolonged period as a result.

7. ### Time allowance

    1.  OKF's initial fee for Fully Managed support is calculated from the
        Time Allowance, which is based on our assessment of your website's
        likely support requirements, as stated in the proposal.

    2.  OKF will track time spent providing the services specified in this
        contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
        of the time required to service your website in any given month.

    3.  In any given month, OKF will carry out all of the services provided
        under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
        Allowance has not been exceeded.

    4.  In any given month, if OKF chooses to complete work in excess of the
        Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
        completed at OKF's absolute discretion and the fact that OKF does so on
        one occasion will not imply that OKF will do so on subsequent occasions.

    4.  In any given month, if OKF chooses not to complete work in excess of
        the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
        will complete that work if OKF's fees for the additional work are paid.
        OKF will not complete any such work without your authorisation.

    6.  The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
        change to OKF's fees.

    7.  OKF will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
        to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
        to a professional standard.

    8.  If your Time Allowance is reguarly exceeded, or almost exceeded, OKF
        may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
        Allowance be increased.

    9.  If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, OKF may require
        you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
        submitting fewer Support Tickets.

    10. The Time Allowance is calculated per month. Unusused time is not carried
        over and may not be used in any subsequent month.

    10. OKF may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
        to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.

    11. The Time Allowance will have no bearing on OKF's provision of the
        services detailed in clauses 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4.

8. ### Installation of plugins

    1.  The terms in this section only apply to you if your website is Fully
        Managed, or if your Partly Managed service includes WordPress plugin
        updates or installation.

    2.  At any time, you may create a Support Ticket to ask us to install a
        plugin on your website.

    3.  If you ask OKF to install a plugin, we will conduct an assessment of
        that plugin intended to give a broad understanding of the kinds of
        security problems that plugin may have.

    4.  Based on OKF's assessment of a plugin, OKF may refuse to install that
        plugin or updates for that plugin.

    5.  Plugin security assessments are intended only to give a broad
        understanding of a plugin's security status. The results are opinions
        only. OKF neither offers any guarantee that a plugin whose assessment
        produced positive results does not contain security vulnerabilities,
        nor that negative results necessarily imply that a plugin does contain
        security vulnerabilities.

9. ### Suspension

    1.  OKF may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
            to our total fee for the preceeding two months' usage of GovPress;
        2.  As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data or another GovPress user's information
            security, or to protect other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, OKF will replace your
        website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.

10. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
        Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.

11. ### Quality

    1.  OKF will deliver work of a professional standard.
    2.  OKF is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        £1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). OKF would be willing to negotiate
        an increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to
        pass on any corresponding increase in the premium.

12. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  OKF cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  OKF will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.
    3.  You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
        including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not
        reasonably practical to deliver bug-free software.
    4.  OKF will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
        failure of the Product.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. OKF can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, OKF's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The total cost of the Project.
        2. The insured sum.

13. ### Confidentiality

    1.  OKF believe that it is best to be open.
    2.  OKF will generally not keep the details of your website
        confidential, including by not limited to:

        1.  The fact that OKF has a commercial relationship with you;
        2.  The nature and goals of your website;
        3.  The cost to host your website.

    3.  However, OKF do regard the following as confidential:

        1.  The specific content of documents or copy that will be
            published on any of your websites that is not yet publicly
            available, most especially the content of forthcoming
            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data OKF aquires during the course of hosting your
            website;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
            is protectively marked.

    4.  If you have addional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
        us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.

        is licensed under a licence that permits sublicensing) OKF licenses all
        intellectual property rights in GovPress to you for the sole purpose
        of carrying out this agreement.

    3.	To the extent that it is not able to give the licence in 14.2 above,

        15.1 above, you shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any

        property rights, may be used as part of the operation of your website
        under this agreement.

    3.	Where, under this agreement, we create works, such as computer programs
        and documentation, that were specifically written for and incorporated
        into your website, then we assign to you (as a future assignment of
        copyright) the copyright in the works, subject to a licence from you to

        particular, as part of any website we may host.

        written notice.
    2.  If any proposed change in these terms puts you at a material
        disadvantage you may send us a written objection, in which case,
        the change will not be binding on you.
    3.  Any such written objection must be sent within 14 days of the
        the notice OKF sends you.
