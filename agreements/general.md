1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between the Open Knowledge Foundation, a company
        registered in England and Wales under number 05133759, trading as
        "OKF", and the organisation or person specified on the order
        summary accompanying this document.

2. ### Definitions

    Work
    :   The Work is a specific set of activities (carried out by OKF for
        a fee) with a tangible outcome.

    Feedback Period
    :   The Feedback Period is the amount of staff time available to make
        small changes and amendments to the Work after we believe it is
        complete.

    Required Materials
    :   Required Materials are things that OKF needs in order to
        complete the Work or part of it, including but not limited
        to images, text content, licences, consents, or clear
        instructions.

3. ### Proposal

    1.  Before starting the Work, OKF will provide a proposal.
    2.  The proposal OKF provides will contain:

        1.  A description of the Work;
        2.  An indication of when the Work will begin and end;
        3.  An estimate of how much staff time the Work will require;
        4.  Our fees;
        5.  Any other information that we have agreed must be recorded
            and agreed prior to the commencement of the Work.

4. ### The Work

    1.  OKF will complete the Work as described in the proposal.
    3.  At any time, you may request that some aspect of the Work
        be changed. OKF will make reasonable efforts to comply
        with that request.
    3.  If the Work changes, OKF may charge additional fees. We will
        agree any such fees with you before proceeding further with
        the Work.
    4.  When we believe the Work has been completed, we will show you
        the Work, and ask for your feedback.
    5.  If you send us feedback, we will (at no extra charge) spend
        more time on the Work, up to a maximum of 15% of the staff
        time estimated in the proposal.
    6.  If you require further changes after this time has been spent,
        OKF will provide a proposal for a new piece of Work.

5. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to complete the Work, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If OKF does not have the Required Materials promptly, we may
        not be able to complete the Work within the deadlines specified
        in the proposal.

6. ### Subcontracting

    1.  At OKF's sole discretion, freelancers or contractors may be used
        in place of OKF employees in order to complete some or all of the Work.
    2.  OKF will not outsource the Work without your prior agreement, which
        must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

7. ### Quality

    1.  OKF will deliver the Work to a professional standard.
    2.  OKF is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        Â£1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). We would be willing to negotiate an
        increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to pass
        on any corresponding increase in the premium.

8. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  OKF cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  OKF will deliver Work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.

        turnover, business, pure economic loss; loss of reputation, 
        and/or goodwill that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as 
        a consequence of the Work.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. OKF can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, OKF's total aggregate liability in contract, tort,
        misrepresentation, restitution, breach of statutory duty or
